                            In this project I made a game in Godot as part of a weekend gamejam with 2 other people. In this game You're a ghost who can only be a ghost at moments in time. I learned how to collaborate with others in a time constrained manner and I was able to learn how to use Godot. 
                            I also learned how to make a user interface, a win screen, player logic, logic for a weapon, enemy logic like pathfinding, and reset logic.

                    <p>
                        In this project for my object-oriented programming class I made a stock program that takes in a stock ticker and outputs a graph of candlesticks for the user that shows the high, low, open, and close of the stock. I learned a lot of c# programming from this experience. I used visual studio and windows forms to create the program.
